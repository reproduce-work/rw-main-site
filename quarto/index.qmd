---

reproduce.work is a framework for developing self-contained, self-documenting scientific projects that facilitate computational reproducibility and data traceability. This project is based from the ground up on a paradigm from software engineering called *containerization*, which is used extensively in applications that require code to be reliably executed across different computing environments and time periods. 

However, **reproduce.work is designed for use by *scientists*** and provides a simple framework that abstracts away from underlying complexities and technical details, providing a streamlined workflow for truly reproducible science. The current goal of the project is to lower the barrier to entry for reproducible science by providing a simple, intuitive framework that can be used by scientists with minimal technical expertise. This allows scientists to focus on their research, rather than the technical details of containerization.


### Usage &amp; Installation

reproduce.work can be used via a simple command-line interface that requires no interaction with the underlying containerization technology.

## Current release

This project is currently in the alpha development phase and serves as proof of concept for further development. Current support is offered for the following stack:

- *Computing environment*: Jupyter (interactive Python)
- *Document environment*: LaTeX
- *Hosting environment*: GitHub
    
The longer-term vision for reproduce.work is as a wrapper framework for the vast majority of scientific computing workflows. As such, it has been designed to accommodate other computing environments (vanilla Python, R, and RStudio, Stata, etc.), document environments (Microsoft Word, HTML), and hosting environments (GitLab, etc.) with future development.
