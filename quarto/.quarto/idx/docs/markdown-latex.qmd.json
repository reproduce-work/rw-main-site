The `variable_name` refers to a specific piece of data or value defined elsewhere, often in a TOML configuration file. When the document is processed, the `INSERT` command is replaced with the actual value of `variable_name`.\n- **Use Case**: Use `INSERT` to dynamically add data like dates, names, or any other variable content that might change or needs to be reused across different documents.\n\n### `LINK` \n- **Syntax**: `\\LINK{variable_name}`\n- **Description**: This command is functionally similar to the `\\INSERT` command, in that it will dynamically insert the value of the `variable_name` from your published data, but it will also wrap that value in a hyperlink to the metadata associated with that variable in the `pubdata.toml` file. Once compiled, it turns into an actual clickable link in the document.\n- **Use Case**: Use `LINK` to embed hyperlinks seamlessly in your text, linking to external resources, references, or related documents without cluttering your markdown with URLs.\n\n### `FILE` \n- **Syntax**: `\\FILE{file_path}`\n- **Description**: This command is used to reference or include external files in the document. `file_path` specifies the location of the file. During processing, the reproduce.work script copies the file into your LaTeX project and allows for you to reference it in your \n- **Use Case**: Use `FILE` when you need to include external resources like images, dynamically generated `.tex` files, or other data that is generated in the process of your research.\n\n### `BADGE` \n- **Syntax**: `\\BADGE{variable_name}`\n- **Description**: This command is inserts a badge --- <a href=\"#\">`source` <img src=\"/files/img/logo.svg\" style=\"display: inline; height: 16px;\" /></a> --- that links directly . The `variable_name` is used to fetch the badge's image URL and other related metadata. This command typically generates a small image, often linked to an external source.\n- **Use Case**: Place a `BADGE` next to or below tables and figures to reference the data/code used to generate them.\n\n### `WRAP` \n- **Syntax**: `\\WRAP{variable_name}`\n- **Description**: This command is similar to the `BADGE` command, but rather than merely inserting the badge in place, it wraps the data referenced by `variable_name` in a table environment and places the badge below the dynamically inserted content.\n- **Use Case**: `WRAP` is most suitable for dynamically generated tables.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Setup\n\nComposing a report in the `markdown-latex` environment allows you to automatically reference and embed dynamically generated content and results from your scientific code.\n\nTo start writing your report, run [`rw develop`](/docs/getting-started.html#develop-rw-develop)\n the markdown file `report/main.md`\n\n\n## Commands\n\n### `INSERT` \n- **Syntax**: `\\INSERT{variable_name}`\n- **Description**: This command is used to insert dynamic content into the document.
