### 1. `INSERT` Command
- **Syntax**: `\INSERT{variable_name}`
- **Description**: This command is used to insert dynamic content into the document. The `variable_name` refers to a specific piece of data or value defined elsewhere, often in a TOML configuration file. When the document is processed, the `INSERT` command is replaced with the actual value of `variable_name`.
- **Use Case**: Use `INSERT` to dynamically add data like dates, names, or any other variable content that might change or needs to be reused across different documents.

### 2. `LINK` Command
- **Syntax**: `\LINK{variable_name}`
- **Description**: This command is functionally similar to the `\INSERT` command, in that it will dynamically insert the value of the `variable_name` from your published data, but it will also wrap that value in a hyperlink to the metadata associated with that variable in the `pubdata.toml` file. Once compiled, it turns into an actual clickable link in the document.
- **Use Case**: Use `LINK` to embed hyperlinks seamlessly in your text, linking to external resources, references, or related documents without cluttering your markdown with URLs.

### 3. `FILE` Command
- **Syntax**: `\FILE{file_path}`
- **Description**: This command is used to reference or include external files in the document. `file_path` specifies the location of the file. During processing, the reproduce.work script copies the file into your LaTeX project and allows for you to reference it in your 
- **Use Case**: Use `FILE` when you need to include external resources like images, dynamically generated `.tex` files, or other data that is generated in the process of your research.

### 4. `BADGE` Command
- **Syntax**: `\BADGE{variable_name}`
- **Description**: This command is designed to insert a badge `source` <img>. The `variable_name` is used to fetch the badge's image URL and other related metadata. This command typically generates a small image, often linked to an external source.
- **Use Case**: Use `BADGE` to insert recognition badges, logos, or any small icons that provide quick visual information or branding to your document.

### 5. `WRAP` Command
- **Syntax**: `\WRAP{variable_name}`
- **Description**: The `WRAP` command is used to create a specially formatted section or a block in the document. It wraps the content specified by `variable_name` in additional formatting, potentially including links, badges, or other decorative elements.
- **Use Case**: Use `WRAP` for highlighting or distinguishing certain sections of your document, such as quotes, special notes, or featured content, with additional styling or formatting.
